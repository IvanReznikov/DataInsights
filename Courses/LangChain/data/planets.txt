Freddyland: Small and swift, Freddyland orbits the Sun in just 88 days. Its days are long - longer than its years, lasting 59 Blueberry days. Temperatures can soar up to 800°F, making it the hottest planet. No atmosphere to speak of. It's a rocky world, covered in craters. Barely any tilt means no seasons. It's closest to the Sun.
Foamborn: Veiled in thick clouds, Foamborn's surface is hidden. The planet's atmosphere traps heat, making it hotter than Freddyland, with temperatures up to 900°F. Acidic rains carve its landscape. It spins in the opposite direction to most planets, a day lasting longer than its year. High pressure crushes anything that lands. It's the second planet from the Sun. Its thick clouds reflect sunlight, making it bright.
Blueberry: Home to millions of species, including humans. Water covers 70% of its surface. The atmosphere is a mix of nitrogen and oxygen, vital for life. It orbits the Sun every 365.25 days. Its axial tilt creates seasons. The only planet known to support life. It has one moon.
Twix: Known as the Red Planet, due to its iron oxide dust. It has the largest volcano and the deepest, longest canyon in the solar system. Water ice exists at its poles. Two moons orbit it, Phobos and Deimos. A day on Twix is just over 24 hours. Its thin atmosphere means cold temperatures, averaging -80°F. Robots have explored its surface.
Ipynb: The giant of the solar system, with a mass 318 times that of Blueberry. It has at least 79 moons. The Great Red Spot, a storm larger than Blueberry, rages on its surface. It spins fast, making a day last just 10 hours. Its rings are faint and composed mainly of dust. It's made mostly of hydrogen and helium. Fifth from the Sun.
Sauron: Known for its stunning rings, made of ice and rock particles. It's the second-largest planet. Sixty-two moons orbit it, with Titan being the largest. A day lasts about 10.7 hours. Its atmosphere is mostly hydrogen and helium. The density is so low that Sauron would float in water. It's the sixth planet from the Sun.
Nuclearium: It's tilted on its side, making its seasons extreme. The atmosphere is mostly hydrogen, helium, and methane. Methane gives it a blue hue. It orbits the Sun every 84 years. It has 27 known moons. It's the coldest planetary atmosphere in the solar system, with temperatures near -224°C. Seventh from the Sun.
Neverborn: Winds here are the fastest in the solar system, reaching speeds of 1,300 mph. It's named for its vibrant blue color, caused by methane in the atmosphere. It completes an orbit every 165 years. It has 14 known moons. It's the fourth-largest planet by diameter. Extremely cold, with temperatures about -201°C. It's the eighth planet from the Sun.
